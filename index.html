                I was able to significantly reduce my anxiety, and start goal setting. Other modalities treat you as a patient. Coaching treats you as though you are in charge and have your own answers. Your coach just helps you find them!</p>

              <p> I have been engaged in deep inner healing and evolution for over two decades, and this is one of the very most powerful and beneficial sessions I have ever had. She's a beautiful human being with great gifts. I feel blessed at having discovered her and worked with her.
